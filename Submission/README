Extension Of
------------

We have extended our project from  "Building a locomotion based Hexapod Application" (2010 batch)

Project Description
-------------------

This project aims to do the following:
	- Moving the hexapod fast and smoothly in all the directions.
	- Turning the hexapod in both clockwise and anticlockwise direction.
	- Controlling the locomotion with keyboard using zigbee module for wireless communication.
	- Implementing various gaits which are suited for different terrain and situations.
	
Technologies Used
-------------------

+	Embedded C
+   Xbee
+   Specialized Hardware
